# Query Registry
## Technique ID
T1012


## Description
Adversaries may interact with the Windows Registry to gather information about the system, configuration, and installed software.

The Registry contains a significant amount of information about the operating system, configuration, software, and security. Some of the information may help adversaries to further their operation within a network.

## Hypothesis
An attacker could query the registry to dertmine  privilege escalation and persistance opportunities.

| Situational Awareness | process WHERE process\_parent\_name == "reg.exe" AND process_command_line == "*"  | [process](https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/OSSEM/blob/master/detection_data_model/data_objects/process.md) | 


## Hunter Notes
* Look at commonly abused Registry keys 
* Filter out known good
* Look for odd parent processes that are spawning *reg.exe
* Does not include other known ways to query the registry through the Windows API
