  "Name":"Malicious Office Documents",
  "Description":"Malicious Office documents often leverage macros to launch commands via cmd.exe or PowerShell. In other cases, Office documents might include script content embedded as an object. When a user double clicks that object, Office will write the script to the %TEMP% folder and execute it using wscript.exe or cscript.exe. Both cases require user interaction, but still represent a common delivery mechanism for additional malware.",
  "Hypothesis":"Adversaries are likely leveraging malicious Office documents to deliver malware within the environment.",

  "Hunter Notes":"Detects most common scenarios using these techniques. More creative attackers will likely be able to conceal activity (using different binaries, renaming binaries, etc) and potentially bypass these detections. Look for any Office application creating processes for cmd.exe, wscript.exe, or cscript.exe. Also search the CommandLine field for any occurence of the string powershell",
