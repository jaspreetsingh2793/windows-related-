# Malicious Office Documents
## Technique ID
T0000\_office\_process\_creation


## Description
Malicious Office documents often leverage macros to launch commands via cmd.exe or PowerShell. In other cases, Office documents might include script content embedded as an object. When a user double clicks that object, Office will write the script to the %TEMP% folder and execute it using wscript.exe or cscript.exe. Both cases require user interaction, but still represent a common delivery mechanism for additional malware.


## Hypothesis
Adversaries are likely leveraging malicious Office documents to deliver malware within the environment

## Hunter Notes
* Detects most common scenarios using these techniques. More creative attackers will likely be able to conceal activity (using different binaries, renaming binaries, etc) and potentially bypass these detections.
* Look for any Office application creating processes for cmd.exe, wscript.exe, or cscript.exe
* Also search the CommandLine field for any occurence of the string powershell
