# Remote Desktop Logon
## Technique ID
T1076


## Description
A remote desktop logon, through RDP, may be typical of a system administrator or IT support, but only from select workstations. Monitoring remote desktop logons and comparing to known/approved originating systems can detect lateral movement of an adversary.


## Hypothesis
Adversaries are moving laterally within my network through RDP connections.

## Data Analytics

| Situational Awareness | event WHERE event_id == "4624" AND logon_type == "10" AND user_name == "Administrator"  | TBD | 


## Hunter Notes
* Basic combination of events to detect RDP activity.
* Logon type 10 (RemoteInteractive): Terminal Services session that is both remote and interactive.
* EID 4776 package name MICROSOFT_AUTHENTICATION_PACKAGE_V1_0 happens when the account used to create the RDP session is a local account and not a domain one.
* EID 4776 OR 4624 Logon Account/Target user name "Administrator" could help to hunt for RDP sessions using the built-in administrator account.
* EID 12 can be used to look for specific registry keys related to Terminal Services being used on an endpoint.
* You can correlate all those events with a time window of 1-3 seconds to reduce the number of false positives when hunting for RDP sessions being created in your environment.
* All these events get created on the target system.
