  "Name":"Local Port Monitor",
  "Description":"A port monitor can be set through the AddMonitor API call to set a DLL to be loaded at startup. This DLL can be located in C:\\Windows\\System32 and will be loaded by the print spooler service, spoolsv.exe, on boot. Alternatively, an arbitrary DLL can be loaded if permissions allow writing a fully-qualified pathname for that DLL to HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Print\\Monitors. The spoolsv.exe process also runs under SYSTEM level permissions.",
  "Hypothesis":"Adversaries are creating persistence in my network by leveraging the process of setting up a local port monitor and executing code at startup.",

  "Hunter Notes":"Combination of EIDs will reduce the number of false positives; pivoting from files created under System32 directory to registry values being set.If this is something that you see often in your environment, then stack the values of Registry keys being created under HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Print\\Monitors\\ and the values being set to \"Drivers\".Stack DLLs being written or created under the System32 directory and check for outliers against known\\whitelisted modules. It could be a good start for this hunt.",
