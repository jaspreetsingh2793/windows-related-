# Accessibility Features
## Technique ID
T1015


## Description
Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in (for example, when the user is on the Windows logon screen). An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.

Two common accessibility programs are C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe, launched when the shift key is pressed five times and C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe, launched when the Windows + U key combination is pressed. The sethc.exe program is often referred to as "sticky keys", and has been used by adversaries for unauthenticated access through a remote desktop login screen.[MITRE](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1015).


## Hypothesis
Adversaries might be using accessibility feature applications in order to maintain persistence and elevate privileges in my environment

## Hunter Notes
* Pretty straighforward query to find the specific accessibility feature applications that allow this technique and its values. This could be automated and converted into a high fidelity rule with the right context
