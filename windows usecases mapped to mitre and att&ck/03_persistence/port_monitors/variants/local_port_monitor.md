# Local Port Monitor
## Technique IF
T1013


## Description
A port monitor can be set through the AddMonitor API call to set a DLL to be loaded at startup. This DLL can be located in C:\Windows\System32 and will be loaded by the print spooler service, spoolsv.exe, on boot. Alternatively, an arbitrary DLL can be loaded if permissions allow writing a fully-qualified pathname for that DLL to HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors. The spoolsv.exe process also runs under SYSTEM level permissions.


## Hypothesis
Adversaries are creating persistence in my network by leveraging the process of setting up a local port monitor and executing code at startup.

## Hunter Notes
* Combination of EIDs will reduce the number of false positives; pivoting from files created under System32 directory to registry values being set.
	* If this is something that you see often in your environment, then stack the values of Registry keys being created under HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors\ and the values being set to "Drivers".
* Stack DLLs being written or created under the System32 directory and check for outliers against known/whitelisted modules. It could be a good start for this hunt.
